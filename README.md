# YOLOv8 Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. The goal is to build a system that can detect and classify objects in images using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. YOLOv8 is a powerful and efficient model capable of performing both object localization and classification in a single forward pass, making it ideal for real-time applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is structured in the YOLOv8 format, consisting of training and validation sets of images with corresponding annotation files. The dataset is prepared in a way that ensures easy training and evaluation for object detection tasks.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can easily set up the environment by running the following command:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
